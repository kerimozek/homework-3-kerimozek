## Description
- There are 3 sections in Tabbar.
- In the first section, the text is fetched with the API and displayed in the tableview.
- In the second section, the image is fetched with the API and displayed in the collectionview.
- The third section can be thought of as a simple 'todo' application. There is a tableview on the main screen and an 'add' button at the top right. There are 2 'textfields' on the page that opens when the 'add' button is pressed. The information entered there is saved to CoreData when the 'save' button is pressed. The data that saved in coredata is displayed in Tableview.
- When you click on any 'row' saved in the Tableview, it goes to the detail page and the detail information appears there. When the 'done' button is pressed, it returns to the main page with tableview and the icon of that 'row' changes to 'done'.
